## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Crickets (no interest) | Pre-launch to friends, build buzz first |
| Technical issues | Thorough testing, quick patch process |
| Negative feedback | Listen, iterate, engage constructively |
| Competitor emerges | Move fast, build community, stay unique |
| Scope creep | Stay focused on core protocol |

---

## 💰 Monetization (Future)

**NOT NOW** - Focus on adoption first.

**Future options:**
- Managed hosting
- Enterprise support
- Premium monitoring
- Training/certification

**Principle:** Core protocol always free and open.
